## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- **`reviewing-code` skill**: replaced unscoped `Bash` with scoped permissions (`Bash(git *)`, `Bash(gh pr *)`, `Bash(gh api *)`, `Bash(rg *)`, `Bash(wc *)`); added `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`LS`/`LSP` for fallback inspection of user-provided file paths
- **24 review sub-agents** (`go-*`, `py-*`, `ts-*`, `web-*` × `qa/impl/tests/idioms/docs/simplify`): scoped unscoped `Bash` to per-language read-only tooling. Top-level engineers (`go-engineer`, `python-engineer`, `typescript-engineer`, `web-engineer`) untouched
- **`writing-python` skill**: expanded "Verify Generated Code" with explicit retry loop (`ruff --fix` → format → `pyright` → repeat until green)
- **`testing-e2e` skill**: expanded Phase 3 with pass criteria, retry steps, and full-suite regression run
- **8 skills**: `TodoWrite` → `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` in frontmatter and prose. Per CC spec, `TodoWrite` is non-interactive/SDK only; interactive sessions use `Task*`
- **`linting-instructions` skill**: model `opus` → `sonnet` (rule-based regex linting doesn't need Opus reasoning)
- **`looking-up-docs` skill**: removed dead `WebSearch` and `mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask` (description explicitly excludes general web search)

### Fixed

- **`mem-history` skill**: added `context: fork` — `get_observations` returns 500–2k tokens per result and was leaking into the main context

### Notes

- All 9 plugins bumped to 1.7.1 to align with marketplace tag
- PR #6 (yogesh-tessl) closed without merge: the "frontmatter validation fix" was based on a third-party Tessl validator, not the Claude Code spec — which explicitly accepts both YAML lists and space-separated strings for `allowed-tools`. Useful prose changes (verify loops) cherry-picked manually

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Private mirror support**: `scripts/rewrite-mirror.py` rewrites plugin manifests (repository URLs, homepage links, plugin names) for private GitHub mirrors — configurable per-mirror name maps in `MIRROR_NAMES`
- **Mirror sync workflow**: `.github/workflows/rewrite-mirror.yml` auto-rewrites manifests on push to mirror repos; condition-gated on `github.repository` to skip the source repo; commits with `[skip ci]` to prevent trigger loops

### Changed

- **Plugin manifests**: All `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` files enriched with full metadata — `author.email`, `author.url`, `homepage` URLs, expanded `keywords` arrays across all 9 plugins
- **`make push`**: Simplified to plain dual-push (`origin` + mirror remotes); CI on mirror repos handles manifest rewrites automatically

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`coding` skill**: Language-agnostic process discipline for all implementation tasks — surfaces assumptions before coding, defines verifiable success criteria first. Complements writing-go/python/typescript/web with process guardrails. Auto-activates on implement/write/create/build/add/develop intent; wired into go-engineer, python-engineer, typescript-engineer, web-engineer agents.
- **`smart-lint.sh` skip gate**: Skip auto-linting via `SKIP_LINT=1 <command>` (transient) or `.nolint` file in project root (persistent, add to `.gitignore`). Useful when editing repos you don't own and want to avoid auto-formatting side-effects.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **test-runner.sh**: Exit 0 (informational) instead of exit 2 (blocking) when no test framework found — prevents spurious "Claude must fix" errors for unknown project types, missing pytest, or missing cargo
- **smart-explore**: Added `context: fork` — file-reading fallback now runs in isolated context
- **documenting-code**: Phase 5 independently verifies changes via `git diff --stat` instead of trusting agent self-report
- **reviewing-cc-config**: Slimmed from 447→237 lines (−47%); agents read RUBRIC.md directly instead of inline rules; added cross-check step; RUBRIC.md now required (no silent fallback)
- **exploring-repos**: Removed unused Read/Grep/Glob from `allowed-tools`

### Changed

- **Model routing** (per Anthropic system cards): `go-impl`, `go-qa`, `py-impl`, `py-qa`, `ts-impl`, `ts-qa` downgraded opus→sonnet (checklist review, 3–5× cost reduction); `go-docs`, `py-docs`, `ts-docs`, `web-docs` upgraded haiku→sonnet (semantic doc quality)
- **Skill descriptions**: Added trigger phrases and NOT-for exclusions to `looking-up-docs`, `researching-web`, `writing-web`, `reviewing-code` for cleaner routing
- **skill-enforcer.sh**: Added negative patterns for 3 overlapping pairs (code/config review, docs/research, web/typescript) — all disambiguation tests pass

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **`reviewing-cc-config` skill**: Review Claude Code configuration (skills, agents, hooks, CLAUDE.md, commands) for context efficiency, signal density, and anti-patterns — derived from Anthropic's "Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents" and Claude Code best practices documentation
- Co-located `RUBRIC.md` with 16 review rules across 4 categories: Context Budget (CB-\*), Signal Density (SD-\*), Architecture (AR-\*), Anti-Patterns (AP-\*)
- Spawns up to 4 parallel review agents per component type with token-capped structured output
- Skill-enforcer trigger patterns for "review config", "config review", "context review", "review skills/agents/hooks"
- Skill count: 31 → 32 (dev-tools: 14 → 15)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-03

New skill: explore public GitHub repositories via DeepWiki AI-generated documentation.

### Added

- **`exploring-repos` skill**: AI-powered exploration of 30,000+ public GitHub repositories via DeepWiki MCP — understand architecture, design patterns, component relationships, and cross-repo comparisons without cloning
- Three DeepWiki MCP tools: `read_wiki_structure` (topic index), `read_wiki_contents` (full wiki), `ask_question` (semantic Q&A with multi-repo support)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) fallback strategy for repos not indexed by DeepWiki — `gh repo view`, `gh api`, `gh search code` work for any public repo
- Tiered fallback chain: DeepWiki → GitHub CLI → Context7 → Perplexity → local clone
- Clear DeepWiki vs Context7 decision table (architecture understanding vs API references)
- Skill-enforcer trigger patterns for "explore repo", "deepwiki", "repo architecture", "how does owner/repo work"

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-02

AGENTS.md adoption and CC-first rebrand.

### Added

- **AGENTS.md generation**: `scripts/generate-agents-md.py` builds `AGENTS.md` from `flat/skills-codex/` with categorized skill tables — compatible with 20+ AI coding tools via the Linux Foundation AGENTS.md standard
- `make agents-md` and `make validate-agents-md` targets
- AGENTS.md badge in README
- Installation section for AGENTS.md-compatible tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin)
- Tests for AGENTS.md generator (16 tests)

### Changed

- **Rebranded** from "cross-platform collection" to "Claude Code plugin suite with portable skill export"
- README tagline, badges, section headers, and Platform Support table updated to CC-first framing
- "Cross-Platform Architecture" section renamed to "Skill Export Architecture"
- Codex/Gemini badges changed from "compatible" to "skill_export"
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` description updated
- `gemini-extension.json` description updated

### Fixed

- GEMINI.md skill drift: added 6 missing skills (`evolving-config`, `learning-patterns`, `linting-instructions`, `mem-history`, `smart-explore`, `using-gemini`) — now lists all 29 skills

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-02

Cross-platform plugin support for OpenAI Codex CLI and Google Gemini CLI.

### Added

- **Codex CLI support**: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifests for all 9 plugins, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` Codex marketplace
- **Gemini CLI support**: `gemini-extension.json` at repo root and per-plugin, `GEMINI.md` context file, `skills/` symlink for Gemini skill discovery
- **Platform-aware skill overlay system** (`scripts/generate-overlays.py`):
  - Three-tier skill classification: GREEN (15 shared), YELLOW (8 auto-stripped), RED (6 hand-authored)
  - CC-specific frontmatter stripping for all non-Claude platforms
  - `<!-- CC-ONLY: begin/end -->` body sentinel markers for section stripping
  - Platform preamble injection with agentic anchors for o3/codex-1 and Gemini models
- 6 hand-crafted `SKILL.codex.md` overlays optimized for o3/codex-1 instruction following: reviewing-code, fixing-code, improving-tests, brainstorming-ideas, deploying-infra, testing-e2e
- `skills-codex/` build output directories in all 9 plugins (29 platform-optimized skills)
- `flat/skills-codex/` symlinks for cross-tool access
- `make overlays` and `make validate-overlays` targets

- CC plugin versions synced from 1.2.0 to 1.2.2

### Changed

- All 9 `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` skills pointer: `./skills/` → `./skills-codex/`
