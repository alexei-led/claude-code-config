# Changelog

All notable changes to this Claude Code configuration are documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):
major = breaking config/hook changes, minor = new skills/features, patch = fixes.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **`sequential-thinking` skill** (`plugins/dev-tools/skills/sequential-thinking/`).
  Replaces the `sequential-thinking` MCP server with a pure-prompting skill
  that produces numbered Thought blocks with explicit `(revises N)` and
  `Branch X from N` markers, terminating in a `### Final` block. Portable
  across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Pi. Eval at
  `tests/skill-evals/dev-tools/sequential-thinking/` (3 cases including a
  trivial-lookup boundary that confirms the skill correctly does NOT activate).
- **Regression test** `tests/test_no_mcp_sequential_thinking_in_plugins.py`
  blocks `mcp__sequential-thinking__` from re-appearing in source plugins.
- **Skill-enforcer trigger** for the new `sequential-thinking` skill (matches
  "step by step", "sequential thinking", "reason through this", "plan this out",
  "branch this approach", revise-and-branch language).

### Changed

- **Skill-enforcer regex bugfix**: replaced `[\s-]` (literal `\`/`s`/`-` in BSD
  grep) with `[[:space:]-]` so optional whitespace-or-hyphen separators in
  patterns like `up-to-date`, `end-to-end`, `step-by-step`, and `stress-test`
  actually match space variants when `/usr/bin/grep` is used. Affected
  previously-broken triggers: `researching-web`, `testing-e2e`, `grill-me`,
  `debating-ideas`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `improving-tests`,
  `searching-code`, `refactoring-code`, `learning-patterns`, `evolving-config`,
  `mem-history`, `ccgram-messaging`, `smart-explore`, `spec:work`, `spec:help`,
  `spec:interview`.
- **Agent skills lists** for `python-engineer`, `go-engineer`,
  `typescript-engineer`, `infra-engineer`, `spec-planner`: dropped
  `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` from `tools`/`allowed-tools`,
  added `sequential-thinking` to `skills`, rewrote body refs to invoke the
  skill instead of the MCP tool.
- **`/spec:work` command**: dropped `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`
  from `allowed-tools`.

### Removed

- **`MCP_Sequential.md`** (orphaned root doc that described the now-replaced
  MCP). README integrations table updated to point at the skill.

### Fixed

- **`claude-mem` 13.0.0 `PreToolUse:Read` crash**: the upstream `bun.lock`
  ships without `zod` (which `worker-service.cjs` requires as `zod/v3`). The
  SessionStart patch script (`~/.claude/scripts/patch-claude-mem-async.sh`,
  chezmoi-tracked) now runs `bun install --no-save` for any cached version
  whose `node_modules/zod` is missing — durable across machines, idempotent.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **Pi TypeScript extensions** (`platforms/pi/extensions/`). 8 extensions that
  mirror Claude-Code-native features in Pi: `smart-lint.ts` (post-edit lint),
  `ask-user-question.ts` (structured ask), `permission-gate.ts` (dangerous bash
  guard), `protected-paths.ts` (blocks writes to `.env`, `.git/`,
  `node_modules/`), `plan-mode/` (`/plan` toggle with step tracking), `todo.ts`
  (`todo` tool + `/todos`, branch-aware state), `subagent/` (single, parallel,
  and chain subprocess spawning), and `structured-output.ts` (terminates the
  agent loop with structured JSON). Deploy via `scripts/install-pi-exports.sh`,
  which now also symlinks `~/.pi/agent/extensions → flat/extensions-pi/`.
- **Gemini CLI hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`). `BeforeTool` on `write_file|replace`
  → `file-protector.sh`; `BeforeTool` on `run_shell_command` → `git-guardrails.sh`;
  `SessionStart` → `session-start.sh`. All commands resolve via `${extensionPath}`.
- **Codex CLI hooks** (`plugins/dev-workflow/hooks/codex.hooks.json`).
  `PreToolUse` on `Bash` → `git-guardrails.sh`; `SessionStart` → `session-start.sh`.

### Changed

- **Codex hook command paths** switched from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` to `$PLUGIN_ROOT`.
  `$PLUGIN_ROOT` is the variable Codex injects for plugin-sourced hooks; the old
  `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` alias still works as a compatibility alias but `$PLUGIN_ROOT`
  is now canonical.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-09

First-class Pi support, ctx7 CLI replacing context7 MCP, Bun runner coverage,
and an overhauled skill-enforcer hook.

### Added

- **Pi agent exports**. `make pi-overlays` + `make pi-agents` produce
  `flat/skills-pi/` (40 skills: 36 mirrored + 4 Pi-only planning skills) and
  `flat/agents-pi/` (5 subagents: `scout`, `planner`, `reviewer`, `worker`,
  `playwright-tester`). Deploy with `scripts/install-pi-exports.sh --apply`
  (no chezmoi needed) or via the chezmoi recipe in `docs/pi-skill-export.md`.
  Pi requires [`@tintinweb/pi-subagents`](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents)
  for `Agent` / `get_subagent_result` / `steer_subagent`.
- **Install-script integration tests** (`tests/test_install_pi_exports.py`)
  cover dry-run, apply, idempotency, backup-on-existing, and nested-target
  creation for `scripts/install-pi-exports.sh`.
- **Bun/bunx runner coverage** across all ctx7 and Playwright skills/agents.
  Allowlists now include `Bash(bunx ctx7@latest *)` and `Bash(bunx playwright *)`
  alongside the npx variants. Body examples show both runners; pick by
  lockfile (`bun.lock`/`bun.lockb` → `bunx`, otherwise `npx`).
- **Tool-first / grounding sections** added to web review agents
  (`web-impl`, `web-qa`, `web-tests`, `web-idioms`, `web-simplify`,
  `web-engineer`). Each requires running `html-validate` / `stylelint` /
  `playwright` first and grounding findings in tool output.
- **Skill-enforcer triggers** for `context7-cli`, `grill-me`, and
  `improve-codebase-architecture`; tightened `reviewing-code` and
  `brainstorming-ideas` to exclude overlapping triggers.
- **MCP migration backlog** (`docs/mcp-migration-backlog.md`) tracks remaining
  MCP→CLI work: perplexity-ask, morphllm, deepwiki, claude-mem,
  sequential-thinking.
- **Pi schedules placeholder** (`.pi/subagent-schedules/README.md`) reserved
  for future cron-style schedules; not deployed by `install-pi-exports.sh`.

### Changed

- **context7 MCP removed from source agents and skills**. 11 Claude Code
  agents (`go-engineer`, `python-engineer`, `typescript-engineer`,
  `infra-engineer`, `web-engineer`, `playwright-tester`, `docs-keeper`, and
  the four `*-simplify` review agents) plus 2 skills (`exploring-repos`,
  `documenting-code`) now invoke `ctx7` via `Bash(ctx7 *)` /
  `Bash(npx ctx7@latest *)` / `Bash(bunx ctx7@latest *)`. Body references
  rewritten to use `ctx7 library` / `ctx7 docs`. Locked by
  `tests/test_no_mcp_context7_in_plugins.py`.
- **Skill instructions strengthened for ctx7 emission**. `context7-cli` and
  `looking-up-docs` now require the response to SHOW the actual `ctx7`
  commands invoked — claiming "I used Context7" without an emitted command
  no longer satisfies the workflow.

### Docs

- **README install rewrite** assumes no chezmoi by default. Each section
  states its CLI prerequisite, links upstream installers, and shows the
  exact symlink targets / settings.json snippets for Codex, Gemini, and Pi.
- **`docs/pi-skill-export.md`** cross-links to `.pi/subagent-schedules/README.md`
  and `docs/mcp-migration-backlog.md`; smoke-check list updated for the new
  `playwright-tester` Pi agent.

### Migration notes

- **Claude Code users**: no action needed. Agents that previously used
  `mcp__context7__*` now use the `ctx7` CLI directly. If `ctx7` is not
  installed, agents fall back to `npx ctx7@latest` / `bunx ctx7@latest`.
- **Codex / Gemini users**: the overlay pipeline already stripped MCP
  references, so behavior is unchanged. Newly added `Bash(bunx …)`
  allowlist entries are pure additions.
- **Pi users (new)**: install `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` then run
  `scripts/install-pi-exports.sh --apply`. See README "Pi" section.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.10.1] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **CI workflow startup**: moved skill-eval workspace configuration out of the invalid `runner.temp` job-level context so GitHub Actions can start CI jobs.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Skill eval automation**: added deterministic unit coverage for skill-eval preparation, summaries, Gemini context generation, and export validation.
- **Gemini context generation**: new `scripts/generate-gemini-md.py` plus `make gemini-md` / `validate-gemini-md` keep `GEMINI.md` generated from `flat/skills-codex/`.
- **Fast skill eval workflows**: `SKILL_EVAL_BASELINE`, `SKILL_EVAL_HTML_REPORT`, `skill-evals-fast`, and `skill-evals-both` speed up local iteration and source-vs-overlay checks.

### Changed

- **Skill quality pass**: tightened eval-driven instructions across development workflow, dev-tools, infra, Python, web, and E2E skills; regenerated Codex/Gemini overlays.
- **Skill export hygiene**: validation now catches stale/missing Gemini skill links, stale Gemini skill counts, and Claude-only tool leaks in Codex/Gemini overlays.
- **Docs**: refreshed README, CONTRIBUTING, skill eval docs, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` for 35 exported skills and the new eval workflows.

### Fixed

- **Gemini drift**: `GEMINI.md` now includes all 35 flat Codex/Gemini skills and the root Gemini extension version/count is current.
- **Overlay portability**: stripped Claude-specific MCP/tool names from generated Codex/Gemini skill overlays.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Architecture-tier linting** in `smart-lint.sh` (`dev-workflow`): wires `knip` (unused exports / files / deps) and `dependency-cruiser` (boundary rules and import cycles) for TypeScript / JavaScript projects. Both opt-in by their own config-file presence (`knip.json`, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, etc.) — no env var to enable. Falls back through `bunx` and `npx` when the binary isn't on `PATH`; emits a stdout install hint (does not block) when no runner is available.
- **Layered hook config** in `smart-lint.sh`: sources `~/.claude/.claude-hooks-config.sh` (global defaults) then `./.claude-hooks-config.sh` (project overrides) so per-project settings override per-user defaults. Per-tool linters keep reading their own project configs (`.golangci.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `.prettierrc`, `knip.json`, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`).
- **`SKIP_ARCH=1` env var and `.nolint-arch` marker file** to skip just the architecture tier without disabling fast-tier linters. Existing `SKIP_LINT=1` and `.nolint` continue to skip everything.
- **`plugins/dev-workflow/docs/lint-tools.md`**: new reference doc with install commands (brew / uv / bun) for every tool the hook touches, architecture-tier opt-in instructions, skip recipes, and a pointer to `.golangci.yml` for Go architecture enforcement (`depguard`, `gomodguard`, `cyclop`, `revive`).

### Fixed

- `lint_shell()` now skips `.claude-hooks-config.sh` files. They are sourced (not executed) and routinely written without shebangs, so shellcheck's `SC2148` was incorrectly blocking edits when a project added per-project hook config.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **`grill-me`** skill (`dev-tools`): focused decision-tree interview on a single existing plan — one question at a time, recommended answer per question, codebase exploration over questions when answerable. Adapted from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT). See `plugins/dev-tools/skills/grill-me/CREDITS.md`.
- **`improve-codebase-architecture`** skill (`dev-workflow`): surface architectural friction and propose deepening opportunities (shallow → deep modules) using a strict module/interface/seam/adapter/leverage/locality vocabulary. Includes `LANGUAGE.md` glossary, `DEEPENING.md` (4 dependency categories: in-process, local-substitutable, remote-owned, true-external), and `INTERFACE-DESIGN.md` ("Design It Twice" parallel sub-agent pattern). Adapted from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT). See `plugins/dev-workflow/skills/improve-codebase-architecture/CREDITS.md`.

### Changed

- **`brainstorming-ideas`** description: routes pure "grill me" requests on a single plan to the new `grill-me` skill; brainstorming-ideas remains the broader brainstorm/design/grill flow.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Git guardrails**: new `git-guardrails.sh` hook blocks destructive git commands such as hard resets, force pushes, branch deletion, destructive checkout/restore, and forced cleans while allowing normal push workflows.

### Changed

- **Workflow skills**: enriched existing skills with diagnosis, TDD, test quality, architecture review, domain vocabulary, and zoom-out guidance instead of adding overlapping new skills.
- **`brainstorming-ideas`**: clarified that it brainstorms ideas and stress-tests draft plans before coding; implementation task breakdown remains `/spec:plan`.
- **Spec commands**: simplified planning around vertical slices, blockers/open questions, out-of-scope checks, and durable completion evidence; removed noisy task taxonomy and stale evidence flags.
- **Skill routing**: updated `skill-enforcer.sh` triggers for debugging, TDD, plan grilling, domain terms, zoom-out search, and architecture review without duplicating intent across skills.
- **Instruction quality checks**: expanded the advisory linter with rules for clear names, trigger-rich descriptions, progressive disclosure, and sequential user questions.
- **Docs and exports**: refreshed README/plugin counts, AGENTS.md, flat symlinks, and Codex/Gemini skill overlays for 33 skills, 34 agents, 10 hooks, and 9 commands.

### Fixed

- **Spec completion docs**: removed references to unsupported `specctl done --evidence` usage and aligned examples with the actual CLI flags.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- **`reviewing-code` skill**: replaced unscoped `Bash` with scoped permissions (`Bash(git *)`, `Bash(gh pr *)`, `Bash(gh api *)`, `Bash(rg *)`, `Bash(wc *)`); added `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`LS`/`LSP` for fallback inspection of user-provided file paths
- **24 review sub-agents** (`go-*`, `py-*`, `ts-*`, `web-*` × `qa/impl/tests/idioms/docs/simplify`): scoped unscoped `Bash` to per-language read-only tooling. Top-level engineers (`go-engineer`, `python-engineer`, `typescript-engineer`, `web-engineer`) untouched
- **`writing-python` skill**: expanded "Verify Generated Code" with explicit retry loop (`ruff --fix` → format → `pyright` → repeat until green)
- **`testing-e2e` skill**: expanded Phase 3 with pass criteria, retry steps, and full-suite regression run
- **8 skills**: `TodoWrite` → `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` in frontmatter and prose. Per CC spec, `TodoWrite` is non-interactive/SDK only; interactive sessions use `Task*`
- **`linting-instructions` skill**: model `opus` → `sonnet` (rule-based regex linting doesn't need Opus reasoning)
- **`looking-up-docs` skill**: removed dead `WebSearch` and `mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask` (description explicitly excludes general web search)

### Fixed

- **`mem-history` skill**: added `context: fork` — `get_observations` returns 500–2k tokens per result and was leaking into the main context

### Notes

- All 9 plugins bumped to 1.7.1 to align with marketplace tag
- PR #6 (yogesh-tessl) closed without merge: the "frontmatter validation fix" was based on a third-party Tessl validator, not the Claude Code spec — which explicitly accepts both YAML lists and space-separated strings for `allowed-tools`. Useful prose changes (verify loops) cherry-picked manually

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Private mirror support**: `scripts/rewrite-mirror.py` rewrites plugin manifests (repository URLs, homepage links, plugin names) for private GitHub mirrors — configurable per-mirror name maps in `MIRROR_NAMES`
- **Mirror sync workflow**: `.github/workflows/rewrite-mirror.yml` auto-rewrites manifests on push to mirror repos; condition-gated on `github.repository` to skip the source repo; commits with `[skip ci]` to prevent trigger loops

### Changed

- **Plugin manifests**: All `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` files enriched with full metadata — `author.email`, `author.url`, `homepage` URLs, expanded `keywords` arrays across all 9 plugins
- **`make push`**: Simplified to plain dual-push (`origin` + mirror remotes); CI on mirror repos handles manifest rewrites automatically

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`coding` skill**: Language-agnostic process discipline for all implementation tasks — surfaces assumptions before coding, defines verifiable success criteria first. Complements writing-go/python/typescript/web with process guardrails. Auto-activates on implement/write/create/build/add/develop intent; wired into go-engineer, python-engineer, typescript-engineer, web-engineer agents.
- **`smart-lint.sh` skip gate**: Skip auto-linting via `SKIP_LINT=1 <command>` (transient) or `.nolint` file in project root (persistent, add to `.gitignore`). Useful when editing repos you don't own and want to avoid auto-formatting side-effects.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **test-runner.sh**: Exit 0 (informational) instead of exit 2 (blocking) when no test framework found — prevents spurious "Claude must fix" errors for unknown project types, missing pytest, or missing cargo
- **smart-explore**: Added `context: fork` — file-reading fallback now runs in isolated context
- **documenting-code**: Phase 5 independently verifies changes via `git diff --stat` instead of trusting agent self-report
- **reviewing-cc-config**: Slimmed from 447→237 lines (−47%); agents read RUBRIC.md directly instead of inline rules; added cross-check step; RUBRIC.md now required (no silent fallback)
- **exploring-repos**: Removed unused Read/Grep/Glob from `allowed-tools`

### Changed

- **Model routing** (per Anthropic system cards): `go-impl`, `go-qa`, `py-impl`, `py-qa`, `ts-impl`, `ts-qa` downgraded opus→sonnet (checklist review, 3–5× cost reduction); `go-docs`, `py-docs`, `ts-docs`, `web-docs` upgraded haiku→sonnet (semantic doc quality)
- **Skill descriptions**: Added trigger phrases and NOT-for exclusions to `looking-up-docs`, `researching-web`, `writing-web`, `reviewing-code` for cleaner routing
- **skill-enforcer.sh**: Added negative patterns for 3 overlapping pairs (code/config review, docs/research, web/typescript) — all disambiguation tests pass

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **`reviewing-cc-config` skill**: Review Claude Code configuration (skills, agents, hooks, CLAUDE.md, commands) for context efficiency, signal density, and anti-patterns — derived from Anthropic's "Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents" and Claude Code best practices documentation
- Co-located `RUBRIC.md` with 16 review rules across 4 categories: Context Budget (CB-\*), Signal Density (SD-\*), Architecture (AR-\*), Anti-Patterns (AP-\*)
- Spawns up to 4 parallel review agents per component type with token-capped structured output
- Skill-enforcer trigger patterns for "review config", "config review", "context review", "review skills/agents/hooks"
- Skill count: 31 → 32 (dev-tools: 14 → 15)

New skill: explore public GitHub repositories via DeepWiki AI-generated documentation.

### Added

- **`exploring-repos` skill**: AI-powered exploration of 30,000+ public GitHub repositories via DeepWiki MCP — understand architecture, design patterns, component relationships, and cross-repo comparisons without cloning
- Three DeepWiki MCP tools: `read_wiki_structure` (topic index), `read_wiki_contents` (full wiki), `ask_question` (semantic Q&A with multi-repo support)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) fallback strategy for repos not indexed by DeepWiki — `gh repo view`, `gh api`, `gh search code` work for any public repo
- Tiered fallback chain: DeepWiki → GitHub CLI → Context7 → Perplexity → local clone
- Clear DeepWiki vs Context7 decision table (architecture understanding vs API references)
- Skill-enforcer trigger patterns for "explore repo", "deepwiki", "repo architecture", "how does owner/repo work"

AGENTS.md adoption and CC-first rebrand.

### Added

- **AGENTS.md generation**: `scripts/generate-agents-md.py` builds `AGENTS.md` from `flat/skills-codex/` with categorized skill tables — compatible with 20+ AI coding tools via the Linux Foundation AGENTS.md standard
- `make agents-md` and `make validate-agents-md` targets
- AGENTS.md badge in README
- Installation section for AGENTS.md-compatible tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin)
- Tests for AGENTS.md generator (16 tests)

### Changed

- **Rebranded** from "cross-platform collection" to "Claude Code plugin suite with portable skill export"
- README tagline, badges, section headers, and Platform Support table updated to CC-first framing
- "Cross-Platform Architecture" section renamed to "Skill Export Architecture"
- Codex/Gemini badges changed from "compatible" to "skill_export"
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` description updated
- `gemini-extension.json` description updated

### Fixed

- GEMINI.md skill drift: added 6 missing skills (`evolving-config`, `learning-patterns`, `linting-instructions`, `mem-history`, `smart-explore`, `using-gemini`) — now lists all 29 skills

Cross-platform plugin support for OpenAI Codex CLI and Google Gemini CLI.

### Added

- **Codex CLI support**: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifests for all 9 plugins, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` Codex marketplace
- **Gemini CLI support**: `gemini-extension.json` at repo root and per-plugin, `GEMINI.md` context file, `skills/` symlink for Gemini skill discovery
- **Platform-aware skill overlay system** (`scripts/generate-overlays.py`):
  - Three-tier skill classification: GREEN (15 shared), YELLOW (8 auto-stripped), RED (6 hand-authored)
  - CC-specific frontmatter stripping for all non-Claude platforms
  - `<!-- CC-ONLY: begin/end -->` body sentinel markers for section stripping
  - Platform preamble injection with agentic anchors for o3/codex-1 and Gemini models
- 6 hand-crafted `SKILL.codex.md` overlays optimized for o3/codex-1 instruction following: reviewing-code, fixing-code, improving-tests, brainstorming-ideas, deploying-infra, testing-e2e
- `skills-codex/` build output directories in all 9 plugins (29 platform-optimized skills)
- `flat/skills-codex/` symlinks for cross-tool access
- `make overlays` and `make validate-overlays` targets
- Codex CLI and Gemini CLI badges in README
- Installation guides for all 3 platforms in README
- Multi-platform manifest templates in CONTRIBUTING

### Fixed

- smart-lint.sh: skip symlinks in markdown formatting (prettier errors on symlinked .md files)
- CI: run overlay build before validation to handle cross-Python serialization
- CC plugin versions synced from 1.2.0 to 1.2.2

### Changed

- All 9 `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` skills pointer: `./skills/` → `./skills-codex/`
- Codex and Gemini get platform-optimized skills instead of CC source
- README structure diagram expanded to show dual-manifest layout
- CONTRIBUTING directory structure shows all 3 platform manifests

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-01

System card-derived instruction hardening for all agents and skills.

### Added

- `linting-instructions` skill: model-based prompt review against system card rules
- `scripts/lint-instructions.py`: advisory regex linter with uv inline deps
- `docs/instruction-lint-rules.md`: 12 rules (6 universal, 3 opus, 3 sonnet) with citations
- `make lint-instructions` target (advisory, doesn't fail CI)
- Skill-enforcer trigger for linting-instructions

### Fixed

- Opus agents (6): add efficiency constraints, tool failure handling, grounding, read-only clauses
- Sonnet agents (24): add anti-eagerness clauses, scope locks for review agents
- `infra-engineer`: add destructive action safety for cloud CLI commands
- `docs-keeper`: add write scope ceiling for Edit/Write/MultiEdit tools
- `web-engineer`: add scope boundaries, failure handling, workflow structure
- `web-docs`: add "Run Tooling First" section (was only doc agent missing it)
- `managing-infra`: add mandatory dry-run before terraform/kubectl/helm apply
- Writing skills (4): add verify-after-generate with build/lint commands
- `committing-code`: add secrets detection guard for .env/pem/credentials
- `documenting-code`, `improving-tests`, `debating-ideas`: add failure handling
- `mem-history`: add scope description and output format template

### Changed

- Skill count: 29 → 30 (new linting-instructions in dev-tools)
- All instruction fixes derived from Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 system cards
