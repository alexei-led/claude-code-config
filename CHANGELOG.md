## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Pi agent exports** (commit `a4ce0fc`): `make pi-overlays`, `make pi-agents`, and
  `flat/skills-pi`/`flat/agents-pi` ship 36 skills mirrored from plugins, 4 Pi-only
  planning skills (`planning-common`, `planning-make`, `planning-exec`,
  `planning-review`), and runtime subagents (`scout`, `planner`, `reviewer`,
  `worker`, `playwright-tester`). Install with `scripts/install-pi-exports.sh
--apply` or chezmoi. Requires [`@tintinweb/pi-subagents`](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents)
  for `Agent`/`get_subagent_result`/`steer_subagent` tools.
- **Install-script integration tests**: `tests/test_install_pi_exports.py` exercises
  dry-run, apply, idempotency, and backup-on-existing behaviors of
  `scripts/install-pi-exports.sh`.
- **Pi schedules placeholder**: `.pi/subagent-schedules/` is reserved for future
  cron-style schedules; see its `README.md` for usage notes.

### Changed

- **Source agents now use ctx7 CLI, not context7 MCP**: 11 agents and 2 skills
  switched from `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`/`mcp__context7__query-docs` to
  `Bash(ctx7 *)` / `Bash(npx ctx7@latest *)` and updated body refs to invoke
  `ctx7 library` / `ctx7 docs` directly. Aligns Claude Code source with the existing
  Pi/Codex/Gemini overlays and unblocks the playwright-tester agent's Pi export.
  Locked by `tests/test_no_mcp_context7_in_plugins.py`.

### Documentation

- **MCP migration backlog**: new `docs/mcp-migration-backlog.md` tracks remaining
  MCP namespaces (perplexity-ask, morphllm, deepwiki, claude-mem, sequential-thinking)
  and per-namespace CLI status.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **CI workflow startup**: moved skill-eval workspace configuration out of the invalid `runner.temp` job-level context so GitHub Actions can start CI jobs.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Skill eval automation**: added deterministic unit coverage for skill-eval preparation, summaries, Gemini context generation, and export validation.
- **Gemini context generation**: new `scripts/generate-gemini-md.py` plus `make gemini-md` / `validate-gemini-md` keep `GEMINI.md` generated from `flat/skills-codex/`.
- **Fast skill eval workflows**: `SKILL_EVAL_BASELINE`, `SKILL_EVAL_HTML_REPORT`, `skill-evals-fast`, and `skill-evals-both` speed up local iteration and source-vs-overlay checks.

### Changed

- **Skill quality pass**: tightened eval-driven instructions across development workflow, dev-tools, infra, Python, web, and E2E skills; regenerated Codex/Gemini overlays.
- **Skill export hygiene**: validation now catches stale/missing Gemini skill links, stale Gemini skill counts, and Claude-only tool leaks in Codex/Gemini overlays.
- **Docs**: refreshed README, CONTRIBUTING, skill eval docs, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` for 35 exported skills and the new eval workflows.

### Fixed

- **Gemini drift**: `GEMINI.md` now includes all 35 flat Codex/Gemini skills and the root Gemini extension version/count is current.
- **Overlay portability**: stripped Claude-specific MCP/tool names from generated Codex/Gemini skill overlays.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Architecture-tier linting** in `smart-lint.sh` (`dev-workflow`): wires `knip` (unused exports / files / deps) and `dependency-cruiser` (boundary rules and import cycles) for TypeScript / JavaScript projects. Both opt-in by their own config-file presence (`knip.json`, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, etc.) — no env var to enable. Falls back through `bunx` and `npx` when the binary isn't on `PATH`; emits a stdout install hint (does not block) when no runner is available.
- **Layered hook config** in `smart-lint.sh`: sources `~/.claude/.claude-hooks-config.sh` (global defaults) then `./.claude-hooks-config.sh` (project overrides) so per-project settings override per-user defaults. Per-tool linters keep reading their own project configs (`.golangci.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `.prettierrc`, `knip.json`, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`).
- **`SKIP_ARCH=1` env var and `.nolint-arch` marker file** to skip just the architecture tier without disabling fast-tier linters. Existing `SKIP_LINT=1` and `.nolint` continue to skip everything.
- **`plugins/dev-workflow/docs/lint-tools.md`**: new reference doc with install commands (brew / uv / bun) for every tool the hook touches, architecture-tier opt-in instructions, skip recipes, and a pointer to `.golangci.yml` for Go architecture enforcement (`depguard`, `gomodguard`, `cyclop`, `revive`).

### Fixed

- `lint_shell()` now skips `.claude-hooks-config.sh` files. They are sourced (not executed) and routinely written without shebangs, so shellcheck's `SC2148` was incorrectly blocking edits when a project added per-project hook config.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **`grill-me`** skill (`dev-tools`): focused decision-tree interview on a single existing plan — one question at a time, recommended answer per question, codebase exploration over questions when answerable. Adapted from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT). See `plugins/dev-tools/skills/grill-me/CREDITS.md`.
- **`improve-codebase-architecture`** skill (`dev-workflow`): surface architectural friction and propose deepening opportunities (shallow → deep modules) using a strict module/interface/seam/adapter/leverage/locality vocabulary. Includes `LANGUAGE.md` glossary, `DEEPENING.md` (4 dependency categories: in-process, local-substitutable, remote-owned, true-external), and `INTERFACE-DESIGN.md` ("Design It Twice" parallel sub-agent pattern). Adapted from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT). See `plugins/dev-workflow/skills/improve-codebase-architecture/CREDITS.md`.

### Changed

- **`brainstorming-ideas`** description: routes pure "grill me" requests on a single plan to the new `grill-me` skill; brainstorming-ideas remains the broader brainstorm/design/grill flow.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Git guardrails**: new `git-guardrails.sh` hook blocks destructive git commands such as hard resets, force pushes, branch deletion, destructive checkout/restore, and forced cleans while allowing normal push workflows.

### Changed

- **Workflow skills**: enriched existing skills with diagnosis, TDD, test quality, architecture review, domain vocabulary, and zoom-out guidance instead of adding overlapping new skills.
- **`brainstorming-ideas`**: clarified that it brainstorms ideas and stress-tests draft plans before coding; implementation task breakdown remains `/spec:plan`.
- **Spec commands**: simplified planning around vertical slices, blockers/open questions, out-of-scope checks, and durable completion evidence; removed noisy task taxonomy and stale evidence flags.
- **Skill routing**: updated `skill-enforcer.sh` triggers for debugging, TDD, plan grilling, domain terms, zoom-out search, and architecture review without duplicating intent across skills.
- **Instruction quality checks**: expanded the advisory linter with rules for clear names, trigger-rich descriptions, progressive disclosure, and sequential user questions.
- **Docs and exports**: refreshed README/plugin counts, AGENTS.md, flat symlinks, and Codex/Gemini skill overlays for 33 skills, 34 agents, 10 hooks, and 9 commands.

### Fixed

- **Spec completion docs**: removed references to unsupported `specctl done --evidence` usage and aligned examples with the actual CLI flags.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- **`reviewing-code` skill**: replaced unscoped `Bash` with scoped permissions (`Bash(git *)`, `Bash(gh pr *)`, `Bash(gh api *)`, `Bash(rg *)`, `Bash(wc *)`); added `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`LS`/`LSP` for fallback inspection of user-provided file paths
- **24 review sub-agents** (`go-*`, `py-*`, `ts-*`, `web-*` × `qa/impl/tests/idioms/docs/simplify`): scoped unscoped `Bash` to per-language read-only tooling. Top-level engineers (`go-engineer`, `python-engineer`, `typescript-engineer`, `web-engineer`) untouched
- **`writing-python` skill**: expanded "Verify Generated Code" with explicit retry loop (`ruff --fix` → format → `pyright` → repeat until green)
- **`testing-e2e` skill**: expanded Phase 3 with pass criteria, retry steps, and full-suite regression run
- **8 skills**: `TodoWrite` → `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` in frontmatter and prose. Per CC spec, `TodoWrite` is non-interactive/SDK only; interactive sessions use `Task*`
- **`linting-instructions` skill**: model `opus` → `sonnet` (rule-based regex linting doesn't need Opus reasoning)
- **`looking-up-docs` skill**: removed dead `WebSearch` and `mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask` (description explicitly excludes general web search)

### Fixed

- **`mem-history` skill**: added `context: fork` — `get_observations` returns 500–2k tokens per result and was leaking into the main context

### Notes

- All 9 plugins bumped to 1.7.1 to align with marketplace tag
- PR #6 (yogesh-tessl) closed without merge: the "frontmatter validation fix" was based on a third-party Tessl validator, not the Claude Code spec — which explicitly accepts both YAML lists and space-separated strings for `allowed-tools`. Useful prose changes (verify loops) cherry-picked manually

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Private mirror support**: `scripts/rewrite-mirror.py` rewrites plugin manifests (repository URLs, homepage links, plugin names) for private GitHub mirrors — configurable per-mirror name maps in `MIRROR_NAMES`
- **Mirror sync workflow**: `.github/workflows/rewrite-mirror.yml` auto-rewrites manifests on push to mirror repos; condition-gated on `github.repository` to skip the source repo; commits with `[skip ci]` to prevent trigger loops

### Changed

- **Plugin manifests**: All `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` files enriched with full metadata — `author.email`, `author.url`, `homepage` URLs, expanded `keywords` arrays across all 9 plugins
- **`make push`**: Simplified to plain dual-push (`origin` + mirror remotes); CI on mirror repos handles manifest rewrites automatically

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`coding` skill**: Language-agnostic process discipline for all implementation tasks — surfaces assumptions before coding, defines verifiable success criteria first. Complements writing-go/python/typescript/web with process guardrails. Auto-activates on implement/write/create/build/add/develop intent; wired into go-engineer, python-engineer, typescript-engineer, web-engineer agents.
- **`smart-lint.sh` skip gate**: Skip auto-linting via `SKIP_LINT=1 <command>` (transient) or `.nolint` file in project root (persistent, add to `.gitignore`). Useful when editing repos you don't own and want to avoid auto-formatting side-effects.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **test-runner.sh**: Exit 0 (informational) instead of exit 2 (blocking) when no test framework found — prevents spurious "Claude must fix" errors for unknown project types, missing pytest, or missing cargo
- **smart-explore**: Added `context: fork` — file-reading fallback now runs in isolated context
- **documenting-code**: Phase 5 independently verifies changes via `git diff --stat` instead of trusting agent self-report
- **reviewing-cc-config**: Slimmed from 447→237 lines (−47%); agents read RUBRIC.md directly instead of inline rules; added cross-check step; RUBRIC.md now required (no silent fallback)
- **exploring-repos**: Removed unused Read/Grep/Glob from `allowed-tools`

### Changed

- **Model routing** (per Anthropic system cards): `go-impl`, `go-qa`, `py-impl`, `py-qa`, `ts-impl`, `ts-qa` downgraded opus→sonnet (checklist review, 3–5× cost reduction); `go-docs`, `py-docs`, `ts-docs`, `web-docs` upgraded haiku→sonnet (semantic doc quality)
- **Skill descriptions**: Added trigger phrases and NOT-for exclusions to `looking-up-docs`, `researching-web`, `writing-web`, `reviewing-code` for cleaner routing
- **skill-enforcer.sh**: Added negative patterns for 3 overlapping pairs (code/config review, docs/research, web/typescript) — all disambiguation tests pass

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **`reviewing-cc-config` skill**: Review Claude Code configuration (skills, agents, hooks, CLAUDE.md, commands) for context efficiency, signal density, and anti-patterns — derived from Anthropic's "Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents" and Claude Code best practices documentation
- Co-located `RUBRIC.md` with 16 review rules across 4 categories: Context Budget (CB-\*), Signal Density (SD-\*), Architecture (AR-\*), Anti-Patterns (AP-\*)
- Spawns up to 4 parallel review agents per component type with token-capped structured output
- Skill-enforcer trigger patterns for "review config", "config review", "context review", "review skills/agents/hooks"
- Skill count: 31 → 32 (dev-tools: 14 → 15)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-03

New skill: explore public GitHub repositories via DeepWiki AI-generated documentation.

### Added

- **`exploring-repos` skill**: AI-powered exploration of 30,000+ public GitHub repositories via DeepWiki MCP — understand architecture, design patterns, component relationships, and cross-repo comparisons without cloning
- Three DeepWiki MCP tools: `read_wiki_structure` (topic index), `read_wiki_contents` (full wiki), `ask_question` (semantic Q&A with multi-repo support)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) fallback strategy for repos not indexed by DeepWiki — `gh repo view`, `gh api`, `gh search code` work for any public repo
- Tiered fallback chain: DeepWiki → GitHub CLI → Context7 → Perplexity → local clone
- Clear DeepWiki vs Context7 decision table (architecture understanding vs API references)
- Skill-enforcer trigger patterns for "explore repo", "deepwiki", "repo architecture", "how does owner/repo work"

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-02

AGENTS.md adoption and CC-first rebrand.

### Added

- **AGENTS.md generation**: `scripts/generate-agents-md.py` builds `AGENTS.md` from `flat/skills-codex/` with categorized skill tables — compatible with 20+ AI coding tools via the Linux Foundation AGENTS.md standard
- `make agents-md` and `make validate-agents-md` targets
- AGENTS.md badge in README
- Installation section for AGENTS.md-compatible tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-02

  - CC-specific frontmatter stripping for all non-Claude platforms
  - `<!-- CC-ONLY: begin/end -->` body sentinel markers for section stripping
  - Platform preamble injection with agentic anchors for o3/codex-1 and Gemini models
- 6 hand-crafted `SKILL.codex.md` overlays optimized for o3/codex-1 instruction following: reviewing-code, fixing-code, improving-tests, brainstorming-ideas, deploying-infra, testing-e2e
