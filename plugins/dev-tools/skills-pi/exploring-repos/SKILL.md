description: Explore public GitHub repositories in Pi using GitHub CLI, local clones,
  and web tools. Use when the user asks how a public repo works, wants architecture
  orientation, or needs repo-level Q&A.

<!-- Pi platform guidance -->
<!-- Use Pi tool names exactly: read, bash, edit, write, ask_user_question, structured_output, todo, Agent, get_subagent_result, steer_subagent, web_search, web_answer, web_research. -->
<!-- Use Agent, get_subagent_result, and steer_subagent for delegated work. -->
<!-- Use ctx7 or npx ctx7@latest through bash when Context7 documentation lookup is required. -->

# Explore Public Repositories in Pi

Use public sources and local clones. Do not assume specialized repo-wiki tools
exist.

## Workflow

1. Normalize the repo as `owner/name`.
2. Check if the repo is already cloned locally.
3. If not, ask before cloning large repos. For quick reads, prefer GitHub URLs
   or `gh repo view`.
4. Use `web_search` or `web_answer` for public docs, README context, release
   notes, or architecture articles.
5. Use `gh` or a shallow clone for code structure when needed.
6. Map architecture from files, not reputation.
7. Use `context7-cli` for library API docs, not repo architecture.

## Commands

```bash
gh repo view owner/name --json name,description,homepageUrl,repositoryTopics
rg -n 'architecture|design|package|module|cmd|src' README.md docs 2>/dev/null
fd 'README|CONTRIBUTING|docs|cmd|src|packages|internal'
```

For a temporary clone:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/owner/name /tmp/name-repo
```

## Output Contract

```markdown
## Repository Map

### Repo
owner/name — <purpose>

### Entry Points
- `path` — role

### Architecture
- component and relationship facts with file references

### Public Docs
- source/result used

### Unknowns
- gaps or unverified claims
```
