# Learn from Session

Extract actionable learnings and generate project-specific customizations. Adapts Claude Code to project patterns over time.

**Use TaskCreate** to track these 8 phases:

1. Discover existing customizations
2. Extract learnings from conversation
3. Categorize by artifact type
4. Distill to concrete artifacts
5. Deduplicate & merge with existing
6. Budget check
7. Present & confirm
8. Apply changes

---

## Phase 1: Discover Existing

Find ALL project customization files:

```bash
# Run these in parallel via Glob
.claude/CLAUDE.md OR CLAUDE.md          # Instructions
.claude/commands/*.md                    # Commands
.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md               # Skills
.claude/settings.json                    # Hooks
.claude/rules/*.md                       # Rules
```

**Record counts** for budget tracking later.

---

## Phase 2: Extract Learnings

Analyze conversation for these signal types:

### Instruction Signals -> CLAUDE.md

| Signal             | Look For                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Corrections        | "no", "wrong", "actually...", "instead..."    |
| Direct guidance    | "always", "prefer", "use X", "never"          |
| Repeated explains  | Same thing clarified 2+ times                 |
| Project quirks     | Unexpected behaviors, edge cases, workarounds |
| Commands/workflows | Specific commands, sequences that worked      |

### Command Signals -> .claude/commands/

| Signal              | Look For                                 | Confidence |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Repeated task       | Same request 3+ times in session/history | HIGH       |
| "I always" pattern  | "I always run X before Y"                | HIGH       |
| Multi-step sequence | "first lint, then test, then build"      | MEDIUM     |
| Template request    | "create a new X like we discussed"       | MEDIUM     |
| Workflow mention    | "my workflow is X then Y then Z"         | HIGH       |

### Skill Signals -> .claude/skills/

| Signal              | Look For                                        | Confidence |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Complex multi-tool  | Workflow spanning 3+ files with analysis        | HIGH       |
| Agent orchestration | "spawn agents to check X and Y in parallel"     | HIGH       |
| Domain expertise    | Detailed tech discussion needing reference docs | MEDIUM     |
| Progressive need    | "for basic use X, for advanced see Y"           | MEDIUM     |

### Hook Signals -> .claude/settings.json

| Signal             | Look For                                 | Confidence |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Blocking rule      | "never do X", "always block Y"           | HIGH       |
| Validation need    | "always run linter after edit"           | HIGH       |
| Format requirement | "use prettier on save", "format on edit" | MEDIUM     |
| Approval pattern   | "ask before destructive commands"        | MEDIUM     |

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains topic**: Extract ONLY learnings related to that topic.
**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--dry-run`**: Show what would be created, don't write.

---

## Phase 3: Categorize

Sort extractions into buckets:

```
Instructions: [list of instruction candidates]
Commands: [list of command candidates with names]
Skills: [list of skill candidates with names]
Hooks: [list of hook candidates with events]
```

**Apply confidence threshold**: Only include HIGH confidence for commands/skills/hooks.
MEDIUM confidence items go to instructions in CLAUDE.md instead.

---

## Phase 4: Distill to Artifacts

### Instructions -> CLAUDE.md format

| Pattern           | Example                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Use X`           | Use prepared statements for SQL              |
| `Prefer X over Y` | Prefer explicit returns over bare err        |
| `When X -> do Y`  | When tests fail -> check CI logs first       |
| `X requires Y`    | Auth endpoints require Bearer token          |
| `Run: \`...\``    | Run: `kubectl rollout restart deploy/api`    |
| `Note: X`         | Note: `Get()` returns `nil, nil` when absent |

**One instruction per line. Max 80 chars.**

### Commands -> .claude/commands/{name}.md

```markdown
---
description: { 1-line description }
allowed-tools: { tools needed, e.g., Bash(make *), Read }
argument-hint: { optional args }
---

# {Command Name}

{Brief purpose}

## Steps

1. {step from conversation}
2. {step from conversation}

## Context

{Any relevant @ references or bash context}
```

### Skills -> .claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: { kebab-case-name }
description: { when to use, triggers }
user-invocable: true
context: fork
allowed-tools: { restrictions if any }
---

# {Skill Name}

{Purpose}

## When to Use

- {scenario 1}
- {scenario 2}

## Workflow

1. {step 1}
2. {step 2}
```

### Hooks -> settings.json addition

```json
{
  "EventType": [
    {
      "matcher": "ToolPattern",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "command-here",
          "timeout": 30
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Default to PostToolUse** (non-blocking) unless explicit blocking requirement.

---

## Phase 5: Deduplicate & Merge

For each artifact type:

1. **Read existing** if file exists
2. **Find overlaps** by topic/name
3. **Merge strategy**:

| Scenario                   | Action                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| New adds specificity       | Update existing with concrete details  |
| New adds example           | Append example to existing             |
| Both have value            | Combine into single comprehensive item |
| New is subset of existing  | Keep existing, skip new                |
| Name collision (cmd/skill) | Merge content into existing file       |

**Prefer updating existing over creating new.**

---

## Phase 6: Budget Check

Recommended limits:

| Artifact  | Limit     | Why                   |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| CLAUDE.md | 200 lines | Context efficiency    |
| Commands  | 10        | Discoverability       |
| Skills    | 5         | Complexity management |
| Hooks     | 5         | Debugging simplicity  |

If exceeding budget:

1. Propose consolidations
2. Identify stale items for removal
3. Warn but allow user to proceed

---

## Phase 7: Present & Confirm

Show ALL proposed changes:

```markdown
## Proposed Changes

### CLAUDE.md (instructions)

Target: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
Lines: X/200

**Updates:**

- [old] -> [merged]

**Additions:**

- New instruction

### Commands

- `/pre-commit` - Run checks before commit
  -> `.claude/commands/pre-commit.md`

### Skills

~ `auth-patterns` - Updated with OAuth2 flow
-> `.claude/skills/auth-patterns/SKILL.md`

### Hooks

- PostToolUse[Edit|Write]: Run prettier
  -> `.claude/settings.json`

---

Rollback: `git checkout .claude/`
```

**STOP**: Use `AskUserQuestion`:

| Header | Question                    | Options                                    |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Action | Apply these customizations? | Apply all / Select items / Edit first / No |

If "Select items": Show multi-select for each category.

---

## Phase 8: Apply

Based on confirmation:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Edit existing lines, add new at appropriate sections
2. **Commands**: Write new .md files, edit existing for merges
3. **Skills**: Create directory + SKILL.md, add reference files if needed
4. **Hooks**: Merge into existing settings.json `hooks` object

### Section Placement (CLAUDE.md)

| Section    | Content                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Patterns   | Architecture, naming, structure  |
| Code Style | Formatting, idioms, conventions  |
| Workflows  | Build, test, deploy commands     |
| Gotchas    | Edge cases, quirks, known issues |

---

## Output

```
LEARNED
=======
Target: .claude/

Instructions: (CLAUDE.md)
  ~ "Use error wrapping" -> "Wrap errors: fmt.Errorf(\"op: %w\", err)"
  + "Note: API returns nil, nil when absent"

Commands: (commands/)
  + /pre-commit - Run lint, test, build

Skills: (skills/)
  + auth-patterns - OAuth2 and JWT handling

Hooks: (settings.json)
  + PostToolUse[Edit]: prettier --write

Budget: 45/200 instructions | 3/10 commands | 1/5 skills | 1/5 hooks
```

---

## Edge Cases

- **Empty session**: "No learnings detected. Try after a longer conversation."
- **All low confidence**: Convert to CLAUDE.md instructions instead
- **No .claude/ directory**: Create it with user permission
- **--dry-run flag**: Show output but skip Phase 8
