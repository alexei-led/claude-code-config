# Multi-Agent Code Review

**Use TodoWrite** to track these 4 phases:

1. Detect languages and scope
2. Spawn review agents (or team)
3. Collect agent results
4. Aggregate and present findings

---

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:**

- `deep` → 6-12 specialized Claude sub-agents (language-specific reviewers)
- `team` → **Agent team mode**: Reviewers challenge each other's findings
- `external` → Add external AI reviewers (Codex + Gemini). **Only if explicitly requested.**

**IMPORTANT:** Without `external` flag, run ONLY Claude agents. Never run Codex or Gemini unless `external` is in arguments.

| Arguments          | Claude Agents                                                       | Mode     | External (Codex + Gemini) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| (none)             | go-engineer, python-engineer                                        | Subagent | ❌ No                     |
| deep               | go-qa, go-idioms, go-tests, go-impl, go-docs, go-simplify (+ py-\*) | Subagent | ❌ No                     |
| team               | go-engineer, python-engineer                                        | **Team** | ❌ No                     |
| deep team          | All 6-12 specialized sub-agents                                     | **Team** | ❌ No                     |
| external           | go-engineer, python-engineer                                        | Subagent | ✅ Yes                    |
| team external      | go-engineer, python-engineer                                        | **Team** | ✅ Yes                    |
| deep team external | All 6-12 specialized sub-agents                                     | **Team** | ✅ Yes                    |

## Step 1: Detect Language & Ask Scope

Detect languages in changes:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '\.(go|py|ts|tsx|html|css|js)$' | head -20
```

Then use AskUserQuestion:

| Header       | Question                   | Options                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Review scope | What code should I review? | 1. **Uncommitted changes** - git diff HEAD 2. **Branch vs master** - git diff master...HEAD 3. **Specific files** - I'll provide paths |

Build git command based on choice.

## Step 2: Spawn Agents or Team (ALL in ONE message)

### Team Mode vs Subagent Mode

**If `team` in `$ARGUMENTS`**: Use agent team for collaborative review with debate.

**Team mode benefits:**

- Reviewers challenge each other's findings
- Competing perspectives surface edge cases
- Faster for complex PRs (parallel independent work)

**Subagent mode benefits:**

- Simpler coordination
- Lower token cost
- Better for straightforward reviews

---

### Default Mode: Language Engineers

For each detected language, spawn ONE Task:

- Go files → `Task(subagent_type="go-engineer", ...)`
- Python files → `Task(subagent_type="python-engineer", ...)`

### Deep Mode: Specialized Sub-Agents

Invoke agents by their `subagent_type` (models defined in agent metadata):

**Go agents** (if Go files detected):

| subagent_type | Focus                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| go-qa         | Logic, security, performance |
| go-tests      | Test coverage, quality       |
| go-impl       | Implementation concerns      |
| go-idioms     | Patterns, error handling     |
| go-docs       | Documentation, comments      |
| go-simplify   | Over-abstraction, dead code  |

**Python agents** (if Python files detected):

| subagent_type | Focus                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| py-qa         | Logic, security, performance |
| py-tests      | Test coverage, quality       |
| py-impl       | Implementation concerns      |
| py-idioms     | Patterns, typing             |
| py-docs       | Docstrings, documentation    |
| py-simplify   | Over-abstraction, dead code  |

**TypeScript agents** (if TypeScript files detected):

| subagent_type | Focus                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ts-qa         | Logic, security, performance |
| ts-tests      | Test coverage, quality       |
| ts-impl       | Implementation concerns      |
| ts-idioms     | Patterns, strict typing      |
| ts-docs       | Documentation, comments      |
| ts-simplify   | Over-abstraction, dead code  |

**Web agents** (if HTML/CSS/JS files detected):

| subagent_type | Focus                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| web-qa        | Security, performance, a11y     |
| web-tests     | E2E/Playwright test quality     |
| web-impl      | Requirements, responsiveness    |
| web-idioms    | Semantic HTML, CSS, JS patterns |
| web-docs      | Comments, ARIA labels           |
| web-simplify  | CSS bloat, unnecessary JS       |

**If `team` NOT in `$ARGUMENTS`** (Subagent mode):

Spawn each agent using its subagent_type directly:

```
Task(subagent_type="{agent}", prompt="Review code from: {git_command}. Output: file:line - Issue. Fix.")
```

Agent's own `model` setting (from metadata) is respected automatically.

**If `team` in `$ARGUMENTS`** (Team mode):

Create an agent team with specialized reviewers:

```
Create an agent team to review code from: {git_command}.

Spawn teammates for detected languages:

{If Go detected}:
- go-qa: Security, logic, OWASP Top 10
- go-idioms: Patterns, error handling, stdlib usage
- go-tests: Test coverage, quality, edge cases
- go-impl: Requirements match, DI, edge cases
- go-docs: Documentation quality
- go-simplify: Over-abstraction, dead code

{If Python detected}:
- py-qa: Security, logic, OWASP Top 10
- py-idioms: Pythonic patterns, type hints
- py-tests: pytest patterns, coverage
- py-impl: Requirements, DI wiring
- py-docs: Docstrings, type hints
- py-simplify: Over-abstraction, complexity

{If TypeScript detected}:
- ts-qa: Security, async safety, OWASP
- ts-idioms: Strict typing, patterns
- ts-tests: Test quality, coverage
- ts-impl: Requirements match
- ts-docs: Documentation
- ts-simplify: Over-engineering

{If Web detected}:
- web-qa: Security, performance, a11y
- web-idioms: Semantic HTML, CSS, JS patterns
- web-tests: E2E/Playwright quality
- web-impl: Requirements, responsiveness
- web-docs: Comments, ARIA labels
- web-simplify: CSS bloat, unnecessary JS

Have reviewers:
1. Review code independently
2. Challenge each other's findings
3. Flag disagreements for discussion
4. Converge on consensus issues

Report format: file:line - Issue. Fix. [Flagged by: agent1, agent2]
```

The team lead will coordinate reviewers and synthesize results.

### External Mode: Add Codex + Gemini (ONLY if `external` in arguments)

**Skip this section entirely if `external` is NOT in `$ARGUMENTS`.**

If `external` IS present, spawn these agents IN PARALLEL with Claude agents:

```
Task(subagent_type="codex-assistant", prompt="review: Review code from {git_command}")
Task(subagent_type="gemini-consultant", prompt="review: Review architecture of {git_command}")
```

**codex-assistant**: Code review for security (OWASP), quality, architecture, testing gaps.
**gemini-consultant**: Architecture alternatives and design trade-offs.

**Remember:** `deep` alone = Claude agents only. `deep external` = Claude + Codex + Gemini.

---

## Step 3: Aggregate & Present

```markdown
## Code Review Summary

**Mode**: {default|deep} {team} {+external}
**Scope**: {description}
**Agents**: {count} reviewers
**Coordination**: {Subagents | Agent Team}

---

### CRITICAL (Must Fix)

- [{source}] `file:line` - Issue. Fix.

### IMPORTANT (Should Fix)

- [{source}] `file:line` - Issue. Fix.

### SUGGESTIONS

- [{source}] `file:line` - Issue. Fix.

---

### Consensus (Multi-Agent Agreement)

| Issue | Flagged By | Confidence |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| ...   | ...        | High       |

### Recommended Actions

1. {prioritized list}
```

### Writing Style

- **Brevity**: One sentence per finding. No preamble, no "I noticed that..."
- **No AI-speak**: Cut "potential", "might", "consider". State what IS wrong
- **Direct**: "This leaks memory" not "This could potentially lead to memory issues"
- **Technical precision**: Include type names, function signatures, line numbers

---

## Examples

```
/reviewing-code                      # Subagents: go-engineer, python-engineer
/reviewing-code deep                 # Subagents: 6-12 specialized (NO external)
/reviewing-code team                 # Agent team: engineers challenge each other
/reviewing-code deep team            # Agent team: all 6-12 specialists with debate
/reviewing-code external             # Subagents: Claude + Codex + Gemini
/reviewing-code deep team external   # Agent team: all specialists + external reviewers
```

**Execute this workflow now.**
