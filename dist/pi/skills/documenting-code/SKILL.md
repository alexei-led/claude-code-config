description: Update project documentation based on code changes. Use when the user
  asks to update docs, document behavior, add README content, or align docs with recent
  implementation changes. NOT for extracting session learnings (use learning-patterns)
  or code-quality feedback (use reviewing-code).

<!-- Pi platform guidance -->
<!-- Use Pi tool names exactly: read, bash, edit, write, ask_user_question, structured_output, todo, Agent, get_subagent_result, steer_subagent, web_search, web_answer, web_research. -->
<!-- Use Agent, get_subagent_result, and steer_subagent for delegated work. -->
<!-- Use ctx7 or npx ctx7@latest through bash when Context7 documentation lookup is required. -->

# Documenting Code

Update docs from code facts, not vibes. Keep docs close to the behavior they
explain.

## Role-gated action

Detect your capability from your tools, not from prose:

- Write-capable role (engineer): apply the doc edits and run the validation check.
- Read-only role (reviewer): identify the stale or missing docs and emit the edits in the Proposed Changes contract under Output. Apply nothing; run nothing — a reviewer has no edit or Bash tools (no `git diff`; work from the changed-file list the caller supplies).

## Language detection and references

Detect the language of the changed implementation from file extensions and load the matching reference for language-specific doc conventions:

- Go → [references/go.md](references/go.md)
- Python → [references/python.md](references/python.md)
- TypeScript → [references/typescript.md](references/typescript.md)
- Web → [references/web.md](references/web.md)

Mixed languages: load each matching reference. Unknown language: use the generic rules below only.

## Workflow

1. Identify changed files with `git diff --name-only` unless the user supplied
   paths.
2. Read the relevant implementation, tests, and existing docs.
3. Use `context7-cli` only when external API behavior or syntax is uncertain.
4. For large doc audits, launch one bounded `Agent` (read-only Explore) to map
   changed behavior. Verify its claims before editing.
5. Update the smallest set of docs that users or maintainers need.
6. Run docs or repo validation.

## What To Update

- README usage or setup when user-visible behavior changes.
- API docs when parameters, output, or errors change.
- Architecture docs when module boundaries or data flow change.
- Generated catalogs only through their generator scripts.
- Plugin docs when skill, agent, hook, or command behavior changes.

## Rules

- Do not document dead or speculative behavior.
- Do not add promotional filler.
- Prefer examples that can be run.
- Keep private paths or secrets out of docs.
- If docs disagree with code, code wins unless the user says the docs are the
  intended contract.

## Verification

Run the narrowest relevant checks, for example:

```bash
markdownlint-cli2 '**/*.md'
make validate
```

If a tool is missing, state that and run the next available check.

## Output

Engineer (applied the doc edits): report the docs changed and the validation result.

Reviewer (identified only — emit the edits as a proposal, apply nothing):

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: <brief description>

File: `path/to/doc`
Action: CREATE | MODIFY | DELETE

Code:
<the doc content, with enough surrounding context to locate it>

Rationale: <which code change makes this doc stale or missing>
```
