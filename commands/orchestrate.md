model: sonnet
---

Use the orchestrator agent to analyze complex requirements and create detailed execution plans.

The orchestrator will:
- Use sequential-thinking MCP for complex planning
- Check basic-memory for relevant project context
- Create detailed task breakdown with validation checkpoints
- Delegate to appropriate specialist agents
- Save outcomes to memory for future reference

Perfect for:
- Complex feature implementation
- Architecture decisions
- Multi-component changes
- Cross-domain problems requiring coordination
- Performance-critical workflows needing optimization

Example usage:
```
/orchestrate "Design and implement user authentication system with JWT tokens"
```
