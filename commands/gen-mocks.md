Use the go-engineer agent to generate mockery mocks for Go interfaces following clean architecture patterns.

The go-engineer will:
- Identify interfaces that need mocking
- Generate mocks using mockery with proper configuration
- Follow Go testing best practices
- Ensure mocks are placed in appropriate directories
- Update test files to use generated mocks

Perfect for:
- Test-driven development
- Unit testing with external dependencies
- Clean architecture testing patterns
- Microservices testing
- Repository pattern testing

Example usage:
```
/gen-mocks
```

This command automatically generates high-quality mocks for your Go interfaces to support comprehensive testing.
