# cc-thingz

Portable skills, agents, and hooks for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Pi — code review, language tooling, infrastructure, testing, and developer utilities. Platform-specific skills are excluded.

## Build

```bash
make build    # compile src/ → dist/ for all four targets (claude, codex, gemini, pi)
make fmt      # auto-fix ruff + shfmt + markdownlint
make check    # full lint (ruff, shellcheck, markdownlint, validate-config)
```

`make build` needs sandbox disabled — uv cache at `~/.cache/uv` is restricted in the CC sandbox.

## Writing Agent/Skill Instructions

LLM signal hierarchy (MDEval benchmark + Perplexity research):

- HIGH: `#` headers, bullet/numbered lists, code blocks — always use
- MEDIUM: `**bold**` — ≤15% of prose lines; use for bullet labels (`- **Label**: desc`) and critical keywords only
- LOW/zero: `_italic_`, `---` horizontal rules, markdown tables, mermaid/ASCII diagrams — never use

Specific rules:

- `**Label:**` on its own line → `### Label` (real header, not bold pseudo-header)
- `**Sentence.** followed by prose` → strip bold, keep as plain sentence
- `---` before `##` or `**bold` → remove (redundant section break)
- `---` before ` ```` ` fence → keep (it's template content showing proposal format)

Run format lint: `make lint-instructions` or use the `/reviewing-instructions` skill for full scoring.

## Agents

Three role agents. A role is a capability envelope plus a reasoning stance no skill can supply. Domain procedure and output format live in skills; language specifics live in each skill's `references/<lang>.md`. Role × skill × references compose — language is not a routing key. Consolidated 39 → 3 (see `docs/agent-audit-2026-05-16.md` and the executed plan in `docs/plans/completed/`).

Envelope enforcement is per-target: Claude and Gemini grant a hard `tools:` allowlist (Gemini via the subagent frontmatter `tools:` field); Codex blocks writes via `sandbox_mode: read-only`; Pi has no tool-allowlist primitive, so the envelope there is a system-prompt directive. Gemini frontmatter has no read-only sandbox primitive, so `advisor` is granted `run_shell_command` and constrained to read-only by its body directive — the same tradeoff as Pi. Descriptions state each role behaviorally so the claim stays true on every target, and omit "use proactively" deliberately — roles are picked by the orchestrator to compose with a skill, not auto-delegated.

- **engineer** — read + write + execute. The only mutator: applies changes and runs the build/test/lint verification on what it changed. Fork target for `writing-{go,python,typescript,web}` and `managing-infra`. Claude preloads `context7-cli` + `smart-explore`; `mem-history` and `sequential-thinking` stay Skill-discoverable to keep spawn context lean.
- **reviewer** — Read + Grep + Glob + LS. Adversarial evaluator (assume bugs exist); emits structured findings/proposals, applies nothing. Non-mutating: tool-enforced on Claude and Gemini, write-blocked on Codex, directive on Pi. Absorbs the review family, code search, and planning (via `spec` / `planning:make`).
- **advisor** — strategic escalation: verdict, ranked risks, next actions. Ships to Codex, Gemini, and Pi; excluded from Claude, which has a built-in advisor. Codex enforces read-only via sandbox; Pi uses xhigh thinking with read-only Bash and transcript-forwarding invocation; Gemini grants a read-only `tools:` allowlist plus `run_shell_command` held read-only by the body directive.
