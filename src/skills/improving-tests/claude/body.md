# Test Improvement

Improve tests by making them behavioral, lean, and useful. Tests are a design tool, not a line-count sport.

Use TaskCreate / TaskUpdate to track:

1. Choose mode
2. Explore test structure
3. Run coverage or failing-test loop
4. Review with language agent
5. Apply improvements one cluster at a time
6. Verify and report

## Phase 1: Choose Mode

`$ARGUMENTS`:

- `review` → identify weak, duplicate, brittle, or missing tests
- `refactor` → combine to table-driven/parametrized/test.each, remove waste
- `coverage` → add tests for uncovered business behavior
- `tdd` → red-green-refactor loop for a feature or bug
- `full` → review + refactor + coverage
- empty → ask what to do

If empty, ask one question at a time with options: review existing, refactor tests, fill coverage gaps, TDD loop, or full improvement.

## Testing Principles

- Test behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details.
- The module interface is the test surface.
- Mock only system boundaries: external APIs, network, time, randomness, filesystem, subprocesses.
- Do not mock your own internal collaborators just to make tests easy.
- Prefer integration-style tests when they give a clear, stable signal.
- One logical assertion per test case; multiple property checks are fine after one setup.
- Delete old shallow tests once deeper interface tests cover the behavior.
- No pointless tests for getters, constructors, default props, or generated glue.

## Phase 2: Background Exploration

Spawn exploration agents in parallel when available:

```text
Test structure scan:
- Find test files: *_test.go, test_*.py, *.test.ts, *.spec.ts
- Identify frameworks and helpers
- Find table-driven / parametrize / test.each patterns
- Locate mocks, fixtures, integration tests

Coverage analysis:
- Go: go test -coverprofile=/tmp/cc-cov.out ./... && go tool cover -func=/tmp/cc-cov.out
- Python: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
- TypeScript: bun test --coverage
```

Exclude generated code, mocks, fixtures, type-only files, and trivial CLI entrypoints from coverage pressure.

## Phase 3: TDD Mode

Use this for `tdd`, `test-first`, or `red-green-refactor` requests.

1. Confirm the public interface and the first behavior.
2. Write one failing test for one behavior.
3. Run it and watch it fail for the expected reason.
4. Implement the smallest code that passes.
5. Run the narrow test.
6. Repeat one vertical slice at a time.
7. Refactor only when green.

Do not write all tests first. Bulk RED creates imagined tests coupled to guessed implementation.

## Phase 4: Review and Improve

Detect the language from file extensions and load `references/<lang>.md` (go/python/typescript/web; mixed → load several; unknown → generic core). The active role handles it: write-capable (engineer) applies improvements; read-only (reviewer) emits them as a structured proposal.

Focus findings on:

- tests coupled to private helpers or call counts
- tests that should be table-driven / parametrized / `test.each`
- duplicate scenarios
- weak mocks (`mock.Anything`, unspecced mocks, untyped `vi.fn`) hiding real behavior
- missing success, error, and edge cases on business logic
- no usable seam for testing real behavior

## Phase 5: Apply Improvements

For refactoring brittle private-helper tests, state the public behavior surface first. Example: `create_user(payload)` is the primary test surface; `_normalize_user_payload()` is not. Replace duplicate helper tests and internal call-count assertions with behavior checks through the public API. Mock only system boundaries. Delete shallow duplicates once the public behavior tests cover them.

Preferred consolidation patterns:

- **Go** — table-driven with `t.Run(tc.name, ...)`
- **Python** — `@pytest.mark.parametrize` with `pytest.param()`
- **TypeScript** — `it.each([{ input, expected, name }])`

Extract helpers only after 3+ repetitions and only when the helper improves readability. Hide setup noise; do not hide the behavior under test.

## Phase 6: Verify and Report

Run and name the relevant verification command for the project. Examples:

```bash
go test ./...
pytest -v
bun test
```

For Python, mention `pytest` or the project-specific equivalent explicitly. For refactor plans in Python projects, include `pytest -v` or the repository's configured `uv run pytest` command by name instead of only saying "run tests." For other stacks, name the equivalent test command instead of saying only "tests passed."

Output:

```text
TEST IMPROVEMENT COMPLETE
=========================
Mode: review | refactor | coverage | tdd | full
Tests changed: N
Waste removed: N
Coverage: before → after (if measured)

Key improvements:
- file:line — change

Verification:
- <command> — pass/fail
```

If no tests or framework exist, report that and ask before creating a new testing stack.
