A **Claude Code** plugin suite — 32 skills, 34 agents, 9 hooks, and 9 commands — with portable skill export for Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md)-compatible tools. Built over 6+ months of daily use and continuous refinement.

Built for Claude Code, with all 32 skills exported as platform-optimized instructions for Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and any tool supporting the AGENTS.md standard.

## Why This Exists

AI coding tools are powerful out of the box, but specialized workflows need specialized prompts. After months of iterating on skills, agents, and hooks across Go, Python, TypeScript, infrastructure, and planning workflows, these plugins encode hard-won patterns:

- **Code review** with parallel multi-agent review and sequential lint-and-check workflows
- **Smart hooks** that auto-suggest skills, lint after edits, protect secrets, and run tests (Claude Code)
- **Spec-driven development** with structured requirements, tasks, and a CLI for project management
- **Infrastructure ops** with validated K8s, Terraform, and Helm deployments
- **Developer utilities** including worktree isolation, codebase search, web research, and brainstorming

Every skill has been manually crafted and refined through real-world use — not generated boilerplate.

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add alexei-led/cc-thingz
/plugin install dev-workflow@cc-thingz
/plugin install go-dev@cc-thingz
```

Use `--scope project` to install into `.claude/settings.json` for team sharing.

### OpenAI Codex CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexei-led/cc-thingz.git
# Codex discovers plugins via .agents/plugins/marketplace.json
codex plugin list
codex plugin install go-dev
```

### Google Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/alexei-led/cc-thingz
```

Individual plugins can also be installed as standalone extensions:

```bash
gemini extensions install --path=./plugins/go-dev
```

### Other AGENTS.md-Compatible Tools

The `AGENTS.md` at the repo root provides a skill catalog readable by any tool supporting the [AGENTS.md standard](https://agents.md) (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, and others).

## Prerequisites

Some plugins use MCP servers for enhanced capabilities. These are optional — plugins degrade gracefully without them.

| MCP Server                                                                                              | Purpose                                     | Used By                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)                                                         | Library and framework documentation lookup  | All 9 plugins                                                            |
| [DeepWiki](https://cognition.ai/blog/deepwiki-mcp-server)                                               | AI-generated wiki for public GitHub repos   | dev-tools                                                                |
| [Perplexity](https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol)                                            | Web research and technical comparisons      | dev-workflow, dev-tools, infra-ops                                       |
| [Sequential Thinking](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking) | Step-by-step reasoning for complex planning | go-dev, python-dev, typescript-dev, infra-ops, spec-system               |

### Claude-Mem Integration

All agents and several skills optionally integrate with [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) for cross-session memory and AST-based code navigation. Install with:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add thedotmack/claude-mem
/plugin install claude-mem@thedotmack
```

**What this enables:**

| Capability                    | Tools Used                                      | Benefit                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| AST code navigation           | `smart_search`, `smart_outline`, `smart_unfold` | 10-20x fewer tokens than reading full files        |
| Cross-session memory          | `search`, `get_observations`, `timeline`        | Find past decisions, known gotchas, recurring bugs |
| Historical context in reviews | `search` + `get_observations`                   | Review agents check past findings before starting  |

**Graceful degradation**: All plugins work without claude-mem. When it's not installed, MCP tools are silently absent — agents fall back to Read/Grep/Glob, and skills skip history checks. No errors, no configuration needed.

**How it works**: Agent frontmatter lists claude-mem MCP tools alongside standard tools. Claude Code silently omits unavailable tools at runtime, so agents always have their core tools (Read, Grep, Glob, LSP) and gain smart_explore/memory tools when claude-mem is present. Skill instructions use "when available" / "if claude-mem available" phrasing to guide Claude's behavior.

## Skills

Skills teach the AI model domain-specific knowledge and workflows. All skills are authored for Claude Code and exported with platform-optimized instructions for Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md)-compatible tools. On Claude Code, the `skill-enforcer` hook auto-suggests relevant skills based on your prompt.

## Skill Export Architecture

All skills are authored for Claude Code and exported via a build system (`scripts/generate-overlays.py`) that produces platform-optimized `skills-codex/` directories. An `AGENTS.md` file is generated from these overlays for broad tool compatibility.

### Platform Support

| Component        | Claude Code                                   | Skill Export (Codex, Gemini, AGENTS.md)             |

### Skill Tiers

| **GREEN**  | 15    | Shared body, CC frontmatter stripped, platform preamble added | `writing-go`, `using-modern-cli`     |
| **YELLOW** | 9     | CC-ONLY body sections stripped, frontmatter cleaned           | `looking-up-docs`, `exploring-repos` |
| **RED**    | 6     | Hand-authored overlays optimized for o3/codex-1               | `reviewing-code`, `fixing-code`      |
